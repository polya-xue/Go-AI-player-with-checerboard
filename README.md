Abstract:
Go is played using a rectangular checkerboard (a square) and round black and white stones. The board is divided into 361 intersecting points with 19 horizontal and horizontal lines. A machine learning approach as an AI player to computer Go combining Monte-Carlo tree search with Alpha-beta search algorithm that has been proposed. In our implementation we optimize the searching time and depth for processing steps. The reliability of our method has been proved to be considerably effective by experimental results.

Experiments:
To show the performance of AI player, we let AI player play head-to-head with PhoenixGo. PhoenixGo is a Go AI program which implements the AlphaGo Zero [1]. It is also known as ”BensonDarr” in FoxGo, ”cronus” in CGOS, and the champion of World AI Go Tournament 2018 held in Fuzhou China [6]. The PhoenixGo engine supports GTP (Go Text Protocol), which means it can be used with a GUI with GTP capability, such as Sabaki. We download Sabaki and run PhoenixGo engine on Sabaki as show in below:
